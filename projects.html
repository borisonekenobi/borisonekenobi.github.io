        <p>
            For the last year and a half, I have been working for Trafalgar Engineering Ltd.. Although they are a civil engineering company, they often have a need for software products. Some of the projects I've worked on for them include; an image resizer tool, a task management system and a report creation tool. On the left, I've added a picture of the task management system, it is my biggest project for them yet!
            <br>
            Most of the software I used to create this system was new to me, and thus required a lot of learning. While working on this project, I learnt about their company database, which uses MySQL and the SQL language, as well as learning the C# programming language and the WinUI 3 library created by Microsoft!

            In the summer of 2023, with a couple of friends, I worked on a platformer game using the Unity Engine. Although we never completed the game, I've added a video of our most recent progress on the right. This was one of my first experiences using the C# programming language and my first ever time using Unity.
            <br>
            Although, the project managed to get a fast start, we eventually abandoned the project due to becoming busy with school and life in general.

        <p>
            This is a mega project I'm working on called C-Snap-Snap. I began working on this project using the WinForms library for C#, later switching it to the newer WinUI 3. This project is meant to be a visual IDE for C++ code similar to Scratch. Although never having programmed in C++, I decided that this would be a great way to practice my programming skills, as well as learn a new language! I haven't put too much work into this project recently, however there still exists a Trello board and Github repo where people can track my progress and hopefully get to use v1.0 of the program soon!

            In 2022, I participated in a small hackathon in the Halton region called Tech Under 20 (TU20). I worked with a small team of friends from my high school to create an app that would allow users to track invasive species of plants and animals! During the time spent in this hackathon, I got to work with many different tools such as; Figma, Android Studio and MongoDB! This was my first time working with some of these products, so it was a great learning experience and thanks to some of my friends having already used some of the products, I managed to learn from them!
            <br>
            This was however, the first time any of us had used a proper database. Thankfully, I managed to pick it up quickly and create a Java program to query the database as well as a Python webscraper to gather information from other websites to help fill our database with plant and animal information.

            In January of 2020, I participated in Hack the North 2020++. This was my first time being part of a hackathon, and I had a ton of fun! I worked with a team of students to make a website that would help connect people with a mentor. During the 36 hours of the hackathon, my team and I put in a ton of work into creating a website with a self made database (I still had not used real databases yet)! At this time, I had only created small and simple websites, so I got a ton of experience using JavaScript, HTML and CSS as well as Node.js for a server that was hosted locally! After the hackathon, my team and I continued to update the website for a long time.
